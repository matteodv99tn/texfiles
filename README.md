# Installation

If you don't want to version your file, you can simply clone the repository wherever you want and import the desired packages:
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/matteodv99tn/texfiles.git 
```

If you instead want to version your project it's preferred to use submodules:
``` sh
git submodule add https://github.com/matteodv99tn/texfiles.git 
# or 
git submodule add git@github.com:matteodv99tn/texfiles.git 
```
